  RUBRIC NAME: Stained Glass

  INTENT: Convincing stained glass window; the image should look like light passing
  through leaded, colored glass panels.

  NON-NEGOTIABLES:
  - Dark lead lines (2-4px, near-black) visibly separate every colored region; no two
    adjacent color fills touch without a leading boundary.
  - Subject is decomposed into distinct glass panels; no region uses continuous gradients
    that would be impossible in real glass.

  CRITICAL BENCHMARKS (must evaluate these first):
  1. Leading Coverage: Continuous dark outlines form a connected network across the
     entire composition; no orphan color regions floating without lead borders.
  2. Panel Discipline: Each bounded region contains a single color or at most a simple
     two-tone gradient suggesting glass curvature; no photorealistic shading within panels.
  3. Jewel-Tone Saturation: Primary palette uses deep, saturated hues (cobalt blue,
     ruby red, emerald green, amber gold, amethyst purple); colors appear rich and
     luminous, not pastel or muddy.

  WHAT TO REWARD:
  - Backlit luminosity: colors appear to glow from within, lighter at center of panels,
    suggesting transmitted light.
  - Consistent lead-line width throughout (uniform came/leading).
  - Gothic or Art Nouveau framing: arched top border, decorative corner rosettes, or
    trefoil motifs.
  - Hierarchical panel sizes: large panels for major forms, smaller tessellated panels
    for backgrounds and borders.
  - Color temperature contrast: warm foreground subjects against cool background glass.
  - Symmetry or near-symmetry in border/frame elements (not necessarily the subject).
  - Visible solder joints or came intersections at panel meeting points.

  WHAT TO PENALIZE:
  - Missing or broken lead lines; adjacent colors blending without separation.
  - Photorealistic rendering within panels (smooth gradients, detailed textures).
  - Pastel, desaturated, or neon colors that don't read as stained glass.
  - Uniform panel sizes throughout (real windows vary panel size with form).
  - No framing element; the composition floats without a window border.
  - Lead lines that vary wildly in width (suggests inconsistent craft).

  TIEBREAKERS:
  - Prefer the image with more complete and consistent lead-line networks.
  - If leading is comparable, choose the one with richer jewel-tone saturation and
    stronger backlit luminosity.
