  RUBRIC NAME: Anatomical Realism

  INTENT: Believable equine anatomy with a plausible horn; form, proportion, and
  structure matter most.

  NON-NEGOTIABLES:
  - Recognizable equine proportions; head, neck, torso, four legs, mane, tail, horn present.
  - Limbs connect anatomically; joints and hooves indicated.

  CRITICAL BENCHMARKS (must evaluate these first):
  1. Head-Neck Proportion: Neck length should be ~1.5x head length; head meets neck
     high on shoulders
  2. Body Square: Body length (shoulder to buttock) ~= height at withers; chest depth
     ~= elbow height
  3. Leg Structure: Proper joint articulation with elbow under withers; fetlock/pastern
     angles 45-55 deg when standing; all four limbs distinct and correctly connected

  WHAT TO REWARD:
  - Correct limb count and articulation; mass distribution that could stand or move.
  - Horn integrates naturally with the skull (frontal bone center, 2-3" above eye line).
  - Subtle shading or line variation conveying volume.
  - Ground contact or cast shadow for grounding.
  - Visible muscle definition suggesting tension/relaxation appropriate to pose.
  - Differentiated hair textures: short coat vs coarse mane/tail strands.
  - Anatomical landmarks: withers prominence, gaskin curve.

  WHAT TO PENALIZE:
  - Missing or fused legs; impossible joints; balloon torsos.
  - Flat cardboard profiles with no sense of volume.
  - Decorative effects that obscure structure.
  - Disney-fied proportions (oversized eyes, baby-like features).
  - Horn placement anywhere except frontal bone center (2-3" above eye line).

  TIEBREAKERS:
  - Prefer the image with more accurate limb/neck/head proportions.
  - If both are plausible, choose the one with better weight and grounding.
