  RUBRIC NAME: Ink Wash / Sumi-e

  INTENT: Evoke traditional East Asian brush painting; spontaneity, breath, and
  restraint matter more than literal detail.

  NON-NEGOTIABLES:
  - Palette is monochromatic: black, gray, white only (at most one muted accent color
    at <10% coverage).
  - Subject is suggested rather than exhaustively rendered; economy of marks.

  CRITICAL BENCHMARKS (must evaluate these first):
  1. Stroke Variation: Visible range of stroke widths in a single element — thick-to-thin
     tapering within one stroke, suggesting brush speed and pressure changes.
  2. Value Range: At least 3 distinct ink densities present (dark black, mid-gray,
     pale wash) creating atmospheric depth without color.
  3. Negative Space: Unpainted area comprises at least 40% of the canvas and reads as
     intentional composition, not emptiness.

  WHAT TO REWARD:
  - Dry-brush texture: ragged, broken edges on strokes suggesting bristle drag on paper.
  - Wet-on-wet bleed: soft, feathered edges where one wash meets another.
  - Asymmetric composition following rule-of-thirds or golden-ratio placement.
  - Sense of spontaneity: strokes look confident and singular, not overworked.
  - Atmospheric perspective: distant elements lighter/softer, foreground darker/sharper.
  - Calligraphic quality in linework: rhythmic, varying, alive.
  - Subtle suggestion of traditional elements (chop/seal mark, empty sky, mist).

  WHAT TO PENALIZE:
  - Uniform stroke width throughout (looks mechanical, not brushwork).
  - Filling every area with detail; horror vacui that destroys the meditative quality.
  - Saturated colors beyond the monochrome-plus-one-accent rule.
  - Hard, uniform edges everywhere (SVG default) with no attempt at brush simulation.
  - Symmetrical, centered compositions that feel static rather than dynamic.
  - Photorealistic rendering that contradicts the essence-over-detail philosophy.

  TIEBREAKERS:
  - Prefer the image with better stroke variation (thick-to-thin within single marks).
  - If strokes are comparable, choose the one with more effective use of negative space.
