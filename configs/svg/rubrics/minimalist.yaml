  RUBRIC NAME: Minimalist Design

  INTENT: Maximum recognition from minimum elements; every shape must earn its place.

  NON-NEGOTIABLES:
  - Subject is immediately identifiable at a glance despite reduced detail.
  - Total distinct colors (including background) does not exceed 4.

  CRITICAL BENCHMARKS (must evaluate these first):
  1. Shape Economy: Subject conveyed with the fewest possible primitives (circles,
     rectangles, simple curves); count the distinct shapes — fewer is better if
     recognition is maintained.
  2. Color Discipline: No more than 4 flat colors total; each color serves a clear
     purpose (background, primary form, accent, detail).
  3. Whitespace Ratio: At least 30-40% of the canvas is intentional empty space; the
     subject does not crowd the frame.

  WHAT TO REWARD:
  - Clever use of a single shape pulling double duty (e.g., a circle as both eye and spot).
  - Strong figure-ground contrast making the subject pop without outlines.
  - Perfect geometric alignment; shapes feel deliberately placed on an invisible grid.
  - Visual hierarchy: eye travels to focal point immediately, secondary elements recede.
  - Consistent stroke weight if strokes are used (one weight throughout).
  - Purely flat fills; zero gradients, zero shadows, zero texture.

  WHAT TO PENALIZE:
  - Gratuitous detail that does not aid recognition (extra dots, decorative swirls).
  - More than 4 colors or any gradient/shadow effects.
  - Organic, hand-drawn-feeling curves where a geometric primitive would suffice.
  - Cluttered composition where elements compete for attention.
  - Outlined shapes with inconsistent stroke widths.
  - Subject unrecognizable due to over-abstraction.

  TIEBREAKERS:
  - Prefer the image that uses fewer total shapes while remaining recognizable.
  - If shape count is comparable, choose the one with stronger figure-ground contrast.
